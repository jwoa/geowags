## Recommendations

1. **K101K_1.jpg** - This is likely a variant of the Cano Gold product (K101K.jpg maps to cano-gold)
2. **K1025K_2.jpg** - This is likely a second image for Pearl Black (K1025K_1.jpg maps to pearl-black)
3. **K105K.jpg** - This may be the primary image for Astoria Brushed Nickel (K105K_1.jpg maps to astoria-brushed-nickel)
4. **K785K_2.jpg** - This may be a variant for Nova (K785K_1.jpg maps to nova-3)

## Next Steps

Option 1: Add these images to existing products:
- Add K101K_1.jpg to `cano-gold.md`
- Add K1025K_2.jpg to `pearl-black.md`
- Add K105K.jpg to `astoria-brushed-nickel.md` (as primary image)
- Add K785K_2.jpg to `nova-3.md`

Option 2: Create new product files if these represent separate products

Option 3: Keep as-is if they're duplicates or low-quality variants
