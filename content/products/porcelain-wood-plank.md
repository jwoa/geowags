Enjoy the warmth and beauty of natural wood without the maintenance. Our Porcelain Wood Plank tiles perfectly mimic the look and texture of real hardwood while offering superior durability and water resistance.

Advanced digital printing technology captures every knot, grain pattern, and color variation found in authentic wood, creating an incredibly realistic appearance. The porcelain construction means no warping, no scratching, and easy maintenance.

Ideal for kitchens, bathrooms, and even outdoor spaces where traditional wood wouldn't be practical.
