Bring warmth and rustic charm to your space with authentic Terracotta Floor Tiles. These hand-crafted tiles feature the rich, earthy tones and natural variations that only genuine terracotta can provide.

Each tile is unique, with subtle color variations and texture that create character and depth. Perfect for Mediterranean, Spanish Colonial, or farmhouse-style interiors. The porous nature allows the tiles to age beautifully over time.

Suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications when properly sealed.
