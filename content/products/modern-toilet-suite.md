Combine sleek design with water efficiency in our Modern Toilet Suite. The wall-hung design creates a floating appearance that makes cleaning effortless and gives your bathroom a spacious, contemporary feel.

Dual-flush technology allows you to choose between 3L or 6L flush options, reducing water consumption without compromising performance. The soft-close seat prevents slamming and adds a touch of luxury.

Premium vitreous china construction with a stain-resistant glaze ensures years of reliable use and easy maintenance.
